    <h1 class = 'display-1'>Yikes! That's A LOT of data</h1>
    <p class="lead">The following search tool pulls from a survey called Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) Report.  In short, it is a boat load of wage information
        for just about every profession you can imagine that covers most regions of the US.  You will find data by city, metro area, state region, and statewide. </p>
    
        <p class = 'lead'>The wages are broken by out by hourly rates and annual earnings, comparing the major percentile groups, means, and medians.  Instead of sorting through literally
            millions lines of data, you can search by the area you are intersted and the occupation you are interested.  Both areas and occupations can somewhat unintuitive names, but 
            this tool searches for wildcards, so as long as you in right ballpark, you should be abel to find what you need.
            </p>

        <p class = 'lead'>*PRO TIP:  Search broad to begin with, perhaps a state wide search, and then you wil see the areas available in that state</p>  

    <h1 class = 'display-5'>That's still a boatload of data!</h1>
    <p class = 'lead'>Okay, calm down...If you only want to see a few lines of data data that populate on your search, click the checkbox next to the row and it will be added to a new a table that 
        includes only the rows you actually want.  From there, you will see the average of rates collected.

        Now go nuts......
